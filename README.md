# Authorial London v2

Ruby-fied remake of Authorial London


## Update 2020
In the process of migrating Authorial London to a new server in 2020, and in the hopes of easing any future redeployments, this site is currently deployed using a docker configuration which can be found at https://github.com/sul-cidr/al-docker-config.  Note that this repo also contains deploy secrets (of really minimal sensitivity, but still), and so is a private repo -- you will get a 404 if you are not a member of the `sul-cidr` org and haven't been explicitly granted access.
